# UnityGaussianSplattingDemo
This a project in Unity that uses the 3D Gaussian splatting add-on to create a realistic simulation. It combines character animations inside an environment that is reconstructed with 3D gaussian splatting.


[Gaussian Splatting](https://github.com/Stam21/GaussianSplattingExample) | This repository is directly linked with this demo, as we reconstructed the model with that code, before using Unity.

This demo includes a camera path using cinemachine and also provides a recorder to record the character's animations, as well as the environment based on the camera path. An example is shown under the folder Recordings.
